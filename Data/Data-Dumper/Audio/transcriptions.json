In image processing, we're given an image and we want to transform this image into a clearer image or an image that's easier to analyze. So let's talk about a clearer image. Let's say you take an image of a scene at night time and it happens to be grainy or noisy for lack of light. We want to be able to remove the noise from the image.",

This can also be done using image processing. So image processing tools lie under the hood in any computer vision system and are extremely important. So here are the topics we are going to cover in this first lecture on image processing. We're going to start with pixel processing, which is the simplest type of image processing you can apply.

We'll see what kind of modifications we can apply to an image using linear image filters. And then we'll argue that there are certain things you want to do to an image that simply cannot be done using convolution. And that takes us to the class of non-linear image filters. You can view these as more algorithmic in nature. You have a pixel in its neighborhood, you want to look",
